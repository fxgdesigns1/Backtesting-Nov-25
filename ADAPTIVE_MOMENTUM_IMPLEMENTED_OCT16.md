# 🎯 ADAPTIVE MOMENTUM STRATEGY - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
**Date:** October 16, 2025 @ 5:15pm London  
**Status:** ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED & READY FOR DEPLOYMENT  
**Approach:** Intelligent adaptive system with regime detection

---

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

### What Was Built:
A sophisticated adaptive momentum trading system that:
1. **Automatically detects market regimes** (trending/ranging/choppy)
2. **Adapts entry criteria** based on market conditions
3. **Targets ~5 quality trades per day** (0-10 acceptable)
4. **Protects profits** with break-even and trailing stops
5. **Finds sniper entries** at pullbacks in trends
6. **NO counter-trending** - only with-trend or at key levels
7. **NO forced trades** - quality over quantity

---

## 📁 FILES CREATED

### 1. Market Regime Detector
**File:** `google-cloud-trading-system/src/core/market_regime.py` (NEW)

**Features:**
- Detects 3 market types:
  - **TRENDING:** ADX ≥25, 70%+ directional consistency
  - **RANGING:** ADX <20, price bouncing between levels
  - **CHOPPY:** ADX 20-25, frequent direction changes
  
- Provides adaptive multipliers:
  - **Trending:** 0.85x (15% easier entry - catch pullbacks)
  - **Ranging:** 1.15x (15% harder - wait for reversals at levels)
  - **Choppy:** 1.30x (30% harder - very selective)

- Additional features:
  - Support/resistance level detection
  - Volatility trend analysis
  - Direction consistency calculation
  - Key level proximity checking

**Code size:** ~400 lines

### 2. Profit Protection System
**File:** `google-cloud-trading-system/src/core/profit_protector.py` (NEW)

**Features:**
- 3-stage profit protection:
  1. **Initial:** Original SL at -0.8%
  2. **+0.5% profit:** Move SL to break-even
  3. **+1.5% profit:** Activate trailing stop (0.8% behind peak)

- Tracks peak prices for longs and shorts
- Never moves stops against position
- Lets winners run (no partial closes per user requirement)
- Provides status monitoring and logging

**Code size:** ~250 lines

## 📝 FILES MODIFIED

### 3. Momentum Trading Strategy
**File:** `google-cloud-trading-system/src/strategies/momentum_trading.py` (MODIFIED)

**Major additions:**
- Imported regime detector and profit protector
- Added adaptive mode flag and configuration
- Implemented sniper entry detection (`_find_sniper_entry`)
- Created adaptive quality scoring (`_calculate_adaptive_quality_score`)
- Created base quality scoring (`_calculate_base_quality_score`)
- Integrated regime detection into signal generation
- Added regime-aware logging

**Key methods added:**
```python
_find_sniper_entry()                    # Detect pullbacks to EMA
_calculate_adaptive_quality_score()     # Regime-based scoring
_calculate_base_quality_score()         # Foundation scoring
```

**New parameters:**
```python
self.adaptive_mode = True
self.target_trades_per_day = 5
self.sniper_mode = True
self.sniper_ema_period = 20
self.sniper_tolerance = 0.002
```

### 4. Strategy Configuration
**File:** `google-cloud-trading-system/strategy_config.yaml` (MODIFIED)

**New sections added:**
```yaml
# ADAPTIVE SETTINGS
adaptive_mode: true
target_trades_per_day: 5
max_trades_per_day: 10
min_trades_today: 0

# PROFIT PROTECTION
profit_protection:
  breakeven_at: 0.005
  trail_at: 0.015
  trail_distance: 0.008

# SNIPER ENTRIES
sniper_mode: true
sniper_ema_period: 20
sniper_tolerance: 0.002
```

## 🎯 HOW IT WORKS

### Regime Detection & Adaptation

#### TRENDING MARKET (ADX ≥25, 70%+ directional)
**Strategy:**
- Lower quality threshold: 70 → **60**
- Easier entry to catch pullbacks
- Look for sniper entries (pullbacks to 20 EMA)
- Expected trades: **5-8/day**

**Example:**
```
GBP_USD trending up strongly
- ADX: 32
- 80% up bars in last 20 periods
- Price pulls back to 20 EMA
- SNIPER entry triggered
- Quality score: 85 (boosted 20% for sniper)
- Threshold: 60
- ✅ TRADE TAKEN
```

#### RANGING MARKET (ADX <20)
**Strategy:**
- Raise quality threshold: 70 → **80**
- Wait for reversals at support/resistance
- Only trade near key levels (within 0.2%)
- Expected trades: **2-4/day**

**Example:**
```
EUR_USD ranging between 1.0850-1.0950
- ADX: 18
- Price at 1.0852 (near support)
- Quality score: 82
- Threshold: 80
- ✅ TRADE TAKEN (reversal at support)
```

#### CHOPPY MARKET (ADX 20-25, unclear)
**Strategy:**
- Raise quality threshold: 70 → **90**
- Very selective - exceptional setups only
- Capital preservation priority
- Expected trades: **0-2/day**

**Example:**
```
USD_JPY choppy, no clear direction
- ADX: 22
- Frequent reversals
- Quality score: 75
- Threshold: 90
- ❌ NO TRADE (below threshold)
```

### Sniper Entry System

**What is a sniper entry?**
- Pullback to 20-period EMA in strong trend
- NOT counter-trend! Still respecting overall direction
- Gets 20% quality boost

**Bullish sniper criteria:**
1. TRENDING market (ADX ≥25)
2. Overall trend is UP
3. Price within 0.2% of 20 EMA
4. Still above EMA (not broken through)
5. Recent momentum not falling hard

**Bearish sniper criteria:**
1. TRENDING market (ADX ≥25)
2. Overall trend is DOWN
3. Price within 0.2% of 20 EMA
4. Still below EMA (not broken through)
5. Recent momentum not rallying hard

### Profit Protection Flow

**Stage 1: Initial (Entry → +0.5%)**
```
Entry: 1.3000
SL: 1.2896 (-0.8%)
TP: 1.3312 (+2.4%)
Status: INITIAL
```

**Stage 2: Break-even (+0.5% → +1.5%)**
```
Price: 1.3065 (+0.5%)
SL moved to: 1.3000 (break-even)
TP: 1.3312
Status: BREAKEVEN
✅ Risk eliminated!
```

**Stage 3: Trailing (+1.5%+)**
```
Price: 1.3195 (+1.5%)
Peak: 1.3195
SL: 1.3090 (0.8% behind peak)
TP: 1.3312
Status: TRAILING

Price moves to: 1.3250 (+1.9%)
Peak: 1.3250
SL automatically moves to: 1.3146
✅ Locking in +1.1% minimum profit!
```
