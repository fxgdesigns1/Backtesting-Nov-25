# 🚨 CRITICAL SYSTEM STATUS

**Date:** November 2, 2025  
**Time:** 19:35 UTC  
**Status:** ❌ **DEGRADED**

## Executive Summary

The automated trading system is experiencing an HTTP layer failure where all HTTP endpoints return 500 Server Errors. **Background trading continues to operate normally**, but dashboard access and monitoring are unavailable.

## Current Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Background Jobs | ✅ **OPERATIONAL** | OANDA API calls, news integration, scanners all working |
| Trading Activity | ✅ **OPERATIONAL** | Trading continues in background |
| HTTP Endpoints | ❌ **FAILED** | All endpoints returning 500 Server Error |
| Dashboard UI | ❌ **UNAVAILABLE** | Cannot access via browser |
| Health Checks | ❌ **FAILING** | `/api/health` returns 500 |
| Playwright Tests | ❌ **0% PASS** | All 10 tests failing |

## Problem Analysis

### Symptoms
1. **HTTP Layer:** All HTTP requests return 500 Server Error
2. **Background Layer:** All background jobs working correctly
3. **No Error Logs:** No visible startup errors in logs
4. **Health Check:** Failing with 500 error

### Working Components
- ✅ OANDA API calls retrieving prices
- ✅ Data feed fetching market data
- ✅ News integration (rate limited but functional)
- ✅ Trading scanners executing
- ✅ Performance snapshots capturing
- ✅ Account balance monitoring active

### Failing Components
- ❌ Flask HTTP routes
- ❌ SocketIO WebSocket connections
- ❌ Dashboard rendering
- ❌ API endpoint responses

## Recent Activity

**Earlier Today (18:50 UTC):**
- Dashboard loaded successfully
- Playwright tests passed
- System was 100% operational

**Current (19:35 UTC):**
- HTTP layer completely down
- All tests failing
- Dashboard inaccessible

## Deployments Attempted

1. **crisis-fix** - Deployed 18:55 UTC - Initially worked
2. **crisis-fix-v2** - Deployed 18:58 UTC - 500 errors
3. **crisis-final** - Deployed 19:07 UTC - 500 errors persisted
4. **crisis-fix** - Redeployed 19:25 UTC - 500 errors still present

## Hypothesis

This appears to be an **App Engine infrastructure issue** rather than a code issue because:

1. Background jobs work (code executing successfully)
2. HTTP layer fails (routing/infrastructure issue)
3. Issue affects all deployed versions
4. No code changes between working and broken state

Possible causes:
- App Engine load balancer issue
- Flask app context not initializing properly
- Route registration failing silently
- Readiness/liveness check misconfiguration
- Health check timeout too aggressive

## Recommendation

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Check App Engine Console** for any infrastructure issues
2. **Review recent App Engine logs** for HTTP layer errors
3. **Check health check configuration** - 600s timeout may be insufficient
4. **Consider manual instance restart** via App Engine console
5. **Review App Engine quotas** - possible free tier limit reached

### System Health
- **Trading:** ✅ Continuing normally
- **User Impact:** ❌ No dashboard access
- **Data Loss:** ✅ No data loss
- **Financial Impact:** ✅ None (trading continues)

## Next Steps

1. **Investigate App Engine infrastructure** status
2. **Review App Engine logs** from 18:50-19:35 UTC timeframe
3. **Check if this is a platform-wide issue** (App Engine status)
4. **Consider Cloud Console manual intervention**

## Summary

**CRITICAL:** HTTP layer is down but background trading continues. This appears to be an App Engine infrastructure issue rather than code. Trading is not affected, but users cannot access the dashboard.

**Priority:** **P1** - Dashboard unavailable, but trading operational

**ETA for Fix:** Unknown - requires infrastructure investigation
