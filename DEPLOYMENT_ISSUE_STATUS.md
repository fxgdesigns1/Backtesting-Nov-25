# DEPLOYMENT ISSUE STATUS

**Date:** November 2, 2025  
**Time:** 19:15 UTC  
**Status:** ❌ **DEGRADED - Deployment Issue**

## Executive Summary

The automated trading system encountered a deployment issue where the Google Cloud App Engine instance is returning 500 errors on all HTTP endpoints, including `/api/health`. Background jobs are running (data fetching, news integration, scanners), but HTTP endpoints are failing.

## Problem

- **Symptom:** All HTTP requests return 500 Server Error
- **Affected Endpoints:** `/api/health`, `/dashboard`, `/api/status`, etc.
- **Background Jobs:** Working correctly (OANDA API calls, news integration, scanners)
- **Root Cause:** Unknown - needs investigation

## Current Configuration

- **Runtime:** Python 3.11
- **Entrypoint:** `python main.py`
- **Instance:** F1 Free Tier
- **Current Version:** `crisis-final` (100% traffic)
- **Working Version:** `crisis-fix` (deployed earlier today, still accessible via direct URL)

## Deployment History

1. **crisis-fix** - Deployed 18:55 UTC - Health checks passing, dashboard loaded
2. **crisis-fix-v2** - Deployed 18:58 UTC - 500 errors on all endpoints
3. **crisis-final** - Deployed 19:07 UTC - 500 errors persist

## Observations

1. **Background Tasks Active:**
   - Data feed fetching prices from OANDA ✅
   - News integration (rate limited but working) ✅
   - Trading scanners running ✅
   - Performance snapshots capturing ✅

2. **HTTP Layer Failing:**
   - All GET requests return 500 ❌
   - Health check failing ❌
   - Readiness check failing ❌

3. **No Error Logs:**
   - No import errors, no syntax errors
   - No initialization failures visible
   - Background jobs logging successfully

## Hypothesis

The issue appears to be in how Flask/SocketIO routes are registered or the Flask app context initialization. Since background jobs work but HTTP endpoints fail, this suggests:

1. Possible issue with `safe_json` decorator implementation
2. Possible issue with route registration order
3. Possible issue with dashboard manager initialization in `get_dashboard_manager()` function
4. Possible App Engine auto-scaling/load balancing issue

## Next Steps

1. **Check Flask app initialization logs** from the deployment
2. **Test `crisis-fix` version** to see if it still works (deployed earlier today)
3. **Compare file diffs** between working `crisis-fix` and failing `crisis-final`
4. **Check if there are recent changes to main.py** that broke the HTTP layer
5. **Consider rolling back to a known working version**

## Working Backup

The `crisis-fix` version deployed at 18:55 UTC was working correctly. This can be accessed via:
- Direct URL: `https://crisis-fix-dot-ai-quant-trading.uc.r.appspot.com`

## Impact

- **Trading:** ✅ Background trading continues to work
- **Dashboard:** ❌ Not accessible
- **Monitoring:** ❌ Not accessible
- **Playwright Tests:** ❌ All failing

## Timeline

- **18:55 UTC:** `crisis-fix` deployed successfully
- **18:58 UTC:** `crisis-fix-v2` deployed with 500 errors
- **19:07 UTC:** `crisis-final` deployed with 500 errors persisting
- **19:15 UTC:** Status report created

## Recommendation

**URGENT:** Investigate the difference between `crisis-fix` (working) and `crisis-final` (broken). Likely a single line change or initialization issue.
