## 📋 Post-Deployment Monitoring Plan

### First 30 Minutes
Monitor logs for:
- ✅ "✅ Price history pre-filled: 450 total bars - READY TO TRADE!"
- ✅ No "Progressive relaxation" messages
- ✅ No "Forcing trades" messages
- ✅ Quality scores in 15-25 range

### First 4 Hours
Expected behavior:
- 0-1 signals from Trump DNA
- Scanner running every 5 minutes
- No crashes or errors

### First 24 Hours
Success criteria:
- 2-4 signals generated
- At least 1 trade entered
- Win rate > 50%
- System stable

### Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Tail live logs
gcloud app logs tail -s default

# Check recent signals
gcloud app logs read --limit=50 | grep "signal generated"

# Check for errors
gcloud app logs read --limit=50 | grep "ERROR"

# View in browser
gcloud app browse
```

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If Zero Signals After 12 Hours

1. Check logs for rejection reasons
2. Lower thresholds further:
   ```python
   # In momentum_trading.py
   self.min_adx = 6.0  # Lower from 7.45
   self.min_quality_score = 15  # Lower from 19.59
   ```
3. Re-deploy

### If Too Many Signals (> 10/day)

1. Raise thresholds slightly:
   ```python
   self.min_adx = 9.0  # Raise from 7.45
   self.min_quality_score = 22  # Raise from 19.59
   ```
2. Re-deploy

### If System Crashes

1. Check logs: `gcloud app logs tail -s default`
2. Rollback to previous version:
   ```bash
   gcloud app versions list
   gcloud app versions migrate PREVIOUS_VERSION_ID
   ```
