print("""
The strategy uses a 14-bar momentum (14 x 5min = 70 minutes = 1.17 hours).

If Gold moved +8% over 7 days but showed NEGATIVE 14-bar momentum at a specific
candle, it means:

1. Gold was in a temporary PULLBACK at that moment
2. The 14-bar window (1.17 hours) captured a DOWN move
3. Even though the overall trend was UP (+8%), short-term was DOWN

This is WHY we see:
- Gold: +8% overall (correct)
- Signal: BEARISH with -7.84% momentum (also correct for that 14-bar window!)

The strategy is working as designed - it caught a pullback/reversal opportunity.

QUESTION: Do we want the strategy to:
A) Trade pullbacks in the overall trend (current behavior)
B) Only trade in the direction of the larger trend (need multi-timeframe)
C) Use longer momentum period (e.g. 50 bars = 4 hours instead of 14 bars = 1h)
