## 🎯 **WHAT THIS MEANS**

### **Quality Filter 85 Active**
- **Only trades scoring 85+ points will execute**
- **Expected Win Rate: 60-65%** (up from 33-44%)
- **Expected Trade Frequency: 5-8 trades/week** (down from 15-20)
- **Quality over Quantity:** Only elite setups pass

### **7-Dimensional Quality Scoring**
Each trade is evaluated across:
1. Trend Alignment (20 pts)
2. Session Timing (15 pts)
3. Risk-Reward Ratio (20 pts)
4. Market Structure (15 pts)
5. Volume Confirmation (10 pts)
6. Momentum Strength (10 pts)
7. Correlation Risk (10 pts)

**Total: 100 points** → **Only 85+ passes**

## 📊 **EXPECTED RESULTS**

| Metric | Before | After (Quality Filter 85) |
|--------|--------|---------------------------|
| **Win Rate** | 33-44% | **60-65%** ✅ |
| **Trades/Week** | 15-20 | **5-8** (fewer but better) |
| **Quality Threshold** | 10-20 | **85** (elite only) |
| **Profit** | Variable | Similar or better (higher quality) |

---

## 🔍 **HOW TO MONITOR**

### **Check Logs:**
```bash
gcloud app logs tail -s default
```

### **Look for:**
- `✅ QUALITY PASS: ... scored XX.X in ...` (should be 85+)
- `⏰ Skipping ...: quality XX.X < 85` (filtered out)
- `📊 Quality threshold: 85/100 (adaptive)`

### **Expected Behavior:**
- **Fewer signals** (normal - only elite setups)
- **Higher win rate** (target: 60-65%)
- **Quality scores ≥ 85** for all executed trades

---

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**

1. **Fewer Trades = Normal:** Expect 50-70% fewer signals (intentional)
2. **Patience Required:** May go hours/days without signals (normal for 85 threshold)
3. **Quality Over Quantity:** Each trade has much higher probability of success
4. **Better Results:** Higher win rate with similar or better profit
