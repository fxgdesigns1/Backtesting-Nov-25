## 🎯 **RECOMMENDATION**

**IMMEDIATE ACTION:**

1. **Check if cloud is actually running**
2. **If not, wake it up or redeploy**
3. **Check logs for errors**
4. **Verify system is scanning for trades**

**The system may be partially down right now.**

Would you like me to:
1. Check cloud deployment status?
2. Try to wake up the cloud instance?
3. Check logs for what's happening?
4. Create a proper status check script?
