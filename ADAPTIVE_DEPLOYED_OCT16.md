## 💡 INTELLIGENT BEHAVIOR

### What Makes It "Adaptive":

1. **Reads Market Conditions:**
   - Analyzes ADX, direction consistency, volatility
   - Classifies each instrument's regime
   - Adjusts approach per instrument

2. **Adapts Entry Criteria:**
   - Trending → Lower bar (60) to catch pullbacks
   - Ranging → Higher bar (80) to wait for levels
   - Choppy → Much higher bar (90) for safety

3. **Smart Entry Selection:**
   - Sniper pullbacks in trends (with trend)
   - Reversals at levels in ranges
   - Very selective in chop

4. **Protects Profits:**
   - Quick break-even at +0.5%
   - Trails from +1.5%
   - Locks in gains automatically

5. **No Forced Behavior:**
   - Won't trade to meet quota
   - Adapts to reality
   - Quality always wins
